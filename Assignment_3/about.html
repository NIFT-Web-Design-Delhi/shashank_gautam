          Kathputli is a join of two rajasthani language words Kath meaning wood
          and Putli meaning a doll. Kathputli means a puppet which is made
          entirely from wood. Kathputli is a string puppet theatre, native to
          Rajasthan, India, and is the most popular form of Indian puppetry.
          Being a string marionette, it is controlled by a single string that
          passes it from the top of the puppet over the puppeteers also known by
          the name of the "kathputliwalas".

      <span class="font-bold">Making of the Face:</span> Different characters
      have different facial structure and expression and are carved accordingly.
      This process is mainly done by the men and is called Chilaai. Craftsmen,
      with the help of chisel and hammer, painstakingly carve the
      face.Generally, there is no difference in the face of the male and that of
      the female puppets. The puppets have no wooden hands and legs and these
      are made in cloth.

      become the most important element of the puppets. Artisans use these
      strings to manipulate the puppets during performances. Proper location of
      the string is necessary for better manoeuvring of the puppet’s actions.
      Strings are mainly attached to the neck, shoulders, hands, legs and head
      of the puppet. These strings are either looped with the fingers of the
      puppeteer or to a small wooden strip which is operated by the lead
      puppeteer. The string attached to the head also connects to the back.
      These strings are strong cotton threads which can bear the load of the
      puppets. Finally, the highly decorative and beautiful puppets are ready to
      perform on different traditional and contemporary themes.

        The natives of Rajasthan still look at Maharana Pratap with great
        respect and admiration, and honour him by telling tales of his bravery
        through various mediums. The reason for this admiration and unfaltering
        loyalty that exists till date is given in the stories recited by the
        puppeteers. The story is a must have in the portfolio of every puppeteer
        and each one has their own variation.

        The principal theme of a kathputli performance relates the story of
        Rajasthani hero Amar Singh Rathore, a Rajput prince of the Nagaur
        kingdom who lived during the reign of the 17th century Mughal (Mogul)
        emperor Shah Jahan. It evokes the life and exploits of Amar Singh
        Rathore in the Mughal court, a life that ended with his treacherous
        death at the hands of a jealous courtier.

        However, the themes of the shows also include: romance, drama, comedy,
        etc. A few shows are known for their unique characters instead of the
        storyline itself. These characters are: the Magician who can detach his
        head from the rest of his body, Anarkali, the snake charmer, Mikael
        Jackson from pop culture who can also do his signature “moon walk” on
        the stage, and many more.
